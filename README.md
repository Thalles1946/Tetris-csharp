# Tetris

## What this project does?
Well, besides the name of the project, i think i can talk more about how it works. This csharp Tetris game uses a 10 x 10 grid, mapped by a 2D array of integer, filled with 0's at the start but with 1's at the occuped positions.

### The start...
The game starts choosing ramdomly one of the three block types configured (I hope your lucky is high :) ), then it position it at the top of the grid and starts to getting it down until it gets to the end of the grid or until it touches another block. But if the actual block is touching the top of the grid and can't go down too, you will loose.

### The controls
You can control the blocks using both right and left arrow keys, besides you can make the block goes down straight just pressing down key.

This was developed from zero, without guides and just with some read of what Tetris game creator thought when creating it (It's always good to study the path to create the future).
